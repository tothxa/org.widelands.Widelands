# widelands-flatpak

**Widelands** is a free (libre / open source) (GPLed), realtime-strategy game.

[Homepage](https://www.widelands.org)

This repo is only for the flatpak package definition ("manifest").


## Requirements

* [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup)
* [flatpak-builder](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html)
* [org.freedesktop.Sdk version 20.08 from flathub.org](#sdk-and-runtime)
* [org.freedesktop.Platform version 20.08 from flathub.org](#sdk-and-runtime)
* [check out submodules](#submodules)

See [below](#details) if you need help installing them.


## Quick Start

When the above are all set up, you can use the provided `compile` shell
script to build the program, the repo and the bundle (`widelands.flatpak`).
Once you have built it, you can test with the provided `run` shell script.

See [below](#build) for details on what they do.


## Updating

If you want to build a different commit, you have to change it in
`org.widelands.Widelands.yaml`. (At least this is how they do it for
flathub, to keep the builds reproducible.) If you have your own local
full git repo of Widelands, then:

1. you should change the source `url:` to the local `path:`
2. you may use `utils/detect_revision.py` in your Widelands source directory
   to generate the version string, and
3. change it at the end of `appdata_stub.patch` and `-DWL_VERSION` in the YAML

The version number in `xdg/org.widelands.Widelands.appdata.xml` (which is
regenerated by this manifest at source extraction time from its stub after
it is patched) will be reported by flatpak, but it is normally only changed
in official releases. You may also consider using just your own fixed
`1.0~something`, and forget about it.

The version number in `WL_VERSION` will be reported by the executable.
This is normally updated during compilation, but this only works if the full
revision history is available. If you don't mind replicating it in the
flatpak build directory, you can comment out `-DWL_VERSION`, and add the
`disable-shallow-clone: true` option to the git source definition. You can
find older versions in the history of this repo where this was used.
Or you may use your own fixed version number here as well, if you don't
want to keep track of the commit you have built from.


## Details

### SDK and runtime

Add repository:

```
$ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists "flathub" "https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo"
```

Install (you can also install systemwide if you have access by removing `--user`):

```
$ flatpak --user install "flathub" "org.freedesktop.Sdk//20.08"
$ flatpak --user install "flathub" "org.freedesktop.Platform//20.08"
```

### Submodules

Clone this repository, then check out the parts to the `shared-modules`
directory:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

Updating submodules later to newest version:

```
$ git submodule update --remote --merge
```

### Build

```
$ flatpak-builder --force-clean build --repo=repo org.widelands.Widelands.yaml
```

`build` is the directory name where flatpak-builder will copy the result.
`--repo=repo` tells flatpak-builder to also make a "repo" in the `repo`
directory. You will need this to create a "bundle", ie. the widelands.flatpak
single file package, but you can also skip it, because it takes a while to
generate after building.

### Test run without installing

```
$ flatpak-builder --run "build" "org.widelands.Widelands.yaml" "widelands"
```

### Debugging

You can enter the runtime environment of the package and run any command
(in this example a shell):

```
$ flatpak-builder --run "build" "org.widelands.Widelands.yaml" "sh"
```

### Build single-file bundle (flatpak package)

The `compile` script does it, but you may want to skip it first, because it
takes a while. You can do it separately with this command (`repo` is the
directory where you generated the repo):

```
$ flatpak build-bundle repo widelands.flatpak org.widelands.Widelands --runtime-repo="https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo"
```

### Install single-file bundle

```
$ flatpak --user install "widelands.flatpak"
```

Again, you can also install systemwide if you have access by removing `--user`

### Run after installing

```
$ flatpak --user run "org.widelands.Widelands"
```

Without `--user` if installed systemwide.

## FAQ

### Does the game have access to the host file system?

No, it is sandboxed.

### Does flatpak-ed Widelands run as superuser?

[No](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/1557). It is a
[MATE](https://github.com/mate-desktop)/[marco](https://github.com/mate-desktop/marco)
[issue](https://github.com/mate-desktop/marco/issues/301).

### Are you the author of Widelands?

No, I only updated the flatpak package for it starting from
[scx's repo](https://github.com/scx/widelands-flatpak)


## Thanks

Thank you to the Widelands team for creating the game and to scx and others
for creating the flatpak manifest.
